# TimeSeriesDiscoveryAndAccess

## Note on Time Series Discovery and Access

 * Authors:  Fran√ßois Bonnarel, Mireille Louys, Laurent Michel, Marco Molinaro, Ada Nebot

 * Abstract : This document presents the issues of Discovery and Access for time series
and proposes a procedure for developping solutions by extending existing
standards. The Discovery phase may follow 4 different modes because it can
be attached to a source in a catalog, or can be selected by constraints on
criteria describing time series either only or in combination with physical
criteria on the sources.
